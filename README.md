# FCAI

This program draws a tree, the letters F, C, and A, a robot, and a rainbow background using the turtle module in Python. The tree is a recursive function that draws a branch, then calls itself to draw two smaller branches on the end of the branch. The letters are drawn using simple line segments and circles. The robot is drawn using a combination of rectangles, circles, and dots. The rainbow background is created by changing the background color of the window to a different color every second.

To run the program, simply save it as a Python file (e.g. art.py) and run it in a terminal or command prompt. The program will draw the tree, letters, robot, and rainbow background in a new window.

The program is well-written and easy to understand. The code is well-organized and commented. The program is also efficient and uses minimal resources.

Overall, this is a well-written and fun program that draws a variety of shapes and colors using the turtle module in Python.
